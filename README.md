## How to run locally on an Android emulator

1. Install your Android development environment by following the [React Native CLI Quickstart instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

1. Add the environment variable FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN.
   One way to do this is to include the following in your `.zshrc` file and restarting your terminal.

   ```
   export FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=<value from 1Password>
   ```

   On Windows machines the following command works for the duration of the terminal session:

   ```
   $env:FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN = '<value from 1Password>'
   ```

1. In the project root directory, install/update dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

1. Open your Android emulator

   1. Open Android Studio
   1. Click "Configure" --> "AVD Manager"
   1. Push the Play arrow in the "Actions" column of the emulator you want to use

1. Run it

   ```
   npm run android
   ```

## How to run locally on an iOS simulator

**_ Note _** This will only work on a Mac.

1. Install your iOS development environment by following the [React Native CLI Quickstart instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

1. Add the environment variable FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN.
   One way to do this is to include the following in your `.zshrc` file and restarting your terminal.

   ```
   export FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=<value from 1Password>
   ```

1. In the project root directory, install/update dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

1. Run it

   ```
   npm run ios
   ```

## How to run on a real device

1. Follow the instructions on https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device
   for your OS and the target device. Note: you need a Mac in order to run on
   an iOS device.

## How to run the tests

1. ```
   npm test
   ```

## How to run the linter

1. ```
   npm run lint
   ```

## How to run Storybook

1. If you are on a Mac, set `STORYBOOK_HOST` to your local IP address in `.env`. For example

   ```
   STORYBOOK_HOST=192.168.0.33
   ```

1. To open Storybook in your browser

   - If you're on a Mac, run

     ```
     STORYBOOK_HOST=<your local IP address> npm run storybook
     ```

   - Otherwise, run

     ```
     npm run storybook
     ```

# How to add or change an encrypted Travis environment variable

Reference: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#encrypting-environment-variables

1. Download the Travis CLI `gem install travis`

1. cd to anywhere in this repo

1. temporarily create a personal access token on GitHub https://github.com/settings/tokens with the following permissions:

   - `repo`
   - `read:packages`
   - `read:org`
   - `read:public_key`
   - `read:repo_hook`
   - `user`
   - `read:discussion`
   - `read:enterprise`

1. login using `travis login --pro --github-token <token from github>`

1. For a given `VAR_NAME` that you want to have value `secret_value`, run
   `travis encrypt --pro VAR_NAME=secret_value`
   which will ask for your GitHub username and password and then
   output your encrypted variable

1. Copy the encrypted variable into `.travis.yml`

1. Delete your personal access token from GitHub
